### Project Description
-  In C, implement a variant of the memcpy function named “bitcpy.”  The function should behave the same as the memcpy function, except the third parameter specifies the number of bits (not bytes) to copy, and this number need not fit evenly into some number of bytes (indicate with comments in your code how you handle the case when this happens).
